Browse Pages by Keyboard
========================

Each manual knows about a linear sequence of its pages. Click
:guilabel:`Next` and :guilabel:`Previous` to move forwards or
backwards in that sequence.

The good news is that these functions are also available
from the keyboard by the "access keys".

  user to jump to a specific part of a web page via the
  keyboard.

Unfortunately each browser seems to use `its own modifier`__ to
make the access key work.
In most web browsers the user invokes the access key by pressing
the "modifier (which often is :kbd:`Alt` or :kbd:`Ctrl`) simultaneously with the
appropriate character on the keyboard. So we have for example:
