NEW: Documentation of Locking API
=================================

2019-03-08 by Sybille Peters

A chapter on the :ref:`t3coreapi:locking-api` is now available in
"TYPO3 Explained". This chapter has been written by Sybille Peters
and reviewed by Markus Klein.

You may have never been aware of the locking API because it works
under the hood in the TYPO3 core.

If you develop an extension and use the :ref:`t3coreapi:caching` or
have other issues where concurrent access of a resource must
be prevented, you should check it out.

As always, you can help to improve the documentation: Create an
`issue <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/TYPO3CMS-Reference-CoreApi/issues/new>`__
or click the "Edit me on GitHub" button on the top right
of any page. Read :ref:`h2document:docs-contribute` in "Writing
Documentation" to find out more.

Integration of CKEditor was introduced with TYPO3 8 LTS in the system extension
rte_ckeditor, thus replacing the previously used "HtmlArea".

Finally, documentation for this system extension was added to the core and is available to be
read `online <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/rte_ckeditor/>`__.

Thanks goes to Benni Mack for writing the initial version of the documentation, Sybille
Peters for converting to reStructuredText and adding additional chapters and
Josef Glatz for further enhancing it.

The community is invited to participate in enhancing it:
