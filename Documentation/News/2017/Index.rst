The FormEngine code construct of the core has been refactored since version 6.2
and is much more flexible in version 7 LTS and 8 LTS.

An overview of the :ref:`FormEngine API <t3coreapi:FormEngine>` has now been added
to :ref:`TYPO3 API documentation <t3coreapi:start>`.

**Contribute:** Don't hesitate to use the "Edit me on Github" button
to improve the documentation.

May the docs be with you!
