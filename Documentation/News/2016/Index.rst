TYPO3 Services Reference updated and expanded
---------------------------------------------

2016-09-07 by Francois Suter

The :ref:`TYPO3 Services References <t3services:start>` manual is finally up to date again
(for TYPO3 CMS 7). What's more it contains a whole new chapter
about authentication services. This chapter also describes the
TYPO3 CMS authentication process on a very general level, the
focus being on services.

Improved home page and menu structure
-------------------------------------

2016-08-31 by Francois Suter

At Martin's request - and after an exchange of ideas - I worked on
improving the content and layout of the docs.typo3.org home page.
This new version should be more useful and includes a side panel
with information for newcomers to TYPO3 CMS.

All others pages were also reviewed and quite a few were restructured
and improved, or placed in a more logical structure. This has
largely improved the main navigation on the left.

If you want to give some feedback, the best way is via the
"typo3-documentation" Slack channel.

Improved Theme: Now it's version 3.6.0
--------------------------------------

2016-06-30 by Martin Bless

`Several issues <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/t3SphinxThemeRtd/commit/e22dd5d567165dbad817a983fcae1dabdc3efab2>`__
with the theme are fixed now. And the `README of the repository
<https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/t3SphinxThemeRtd>`__
now has a pointer to the DEMO DOCS `t3SphinxThemeRtdDemoDocs
<https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/drafts/github/TYPO3-Documentation/t3SphinxThemeRtdDemoDocs/>`__
which are kind of a "stresstest" for the theme and demonstrate what's possible.

New: A `.. rst-class:: panel panel-default` right before a section (headline) will give it a Twitter-Bootstrap
-like "panel" styling as you can see on this page with the latest news.

New: The theme is version 3.6.0 now. Get it the regular way from `PyPi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`__
by doing:

`sudo pip install --upgrade t3SphinxThemeRtd`

Enjoy!

TypoScript Syntax Reference updated
-----------------------------------

2016-05-31 by François Suter

The `TypoScript Syntax Reference <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/TyposcriptSyntaxReference/>`__
is now up to date again for TYPO3 CMS 7. It was partly restructured
to remove redundancies and globally make for a more consistent reading.
Some obsolete parts were dropped.

Templating Tutorial updated
---------------------------

2016-05-12 by François Suter

The `Templating Tutorial (Basics)
<https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/TemplatingTutorial/>`__
is now up to date again.
More than refreshed, it was really refactored. This tutorial was accompanied by
files delivered via the extension called "doc_tut_templating". I have now made
this extension into a distribution, which makes it possible to deliver not only
the files but also a basic page tree with a few content element. This greatly
simplifies the early steps of the tutorial, which were redundant with the
Editors Tutorial.
I have reworked a lot of the content, which was quite verbose. It is now often
shorter and more to the point. I removed the chapter about "optionSplit",
which was confusing, and referred readers to the TypoScript Reference instead.
This ended up being a lot of work and this time I used all the time I had
planned in this budget milestone.
