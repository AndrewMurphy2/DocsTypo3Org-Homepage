HELP: My extension documentation was rendered with the OLD layout!
------------------------------------------------------------------

2018-02-13 by Martin Bless

That is actually a good sign. Why? Read on!

Shortly after an extension upload to the TER the documentation server will
render the documentation that (hopefully!) comes with that version.
BUT: At the moment this automatic rendering process still uses the old layout.
Unfortunately the current server is very old and can't run the new toolchain.
And we haven't managed to switch everything to a new server yet. That is why
you initially may feel you've done something wrong because that outdated
layout is used.
At the moment I'm running the new toolchain manually "every now and then" from my
local machine. In general that should happen at least once a day. The plan is,
of course, to set up a fully automated process for that. But we can't foresee
at the moment when exactly that will be.

What does this mean? If you see your documentation in the old layout that
actually is a good sign. It proofs that the documentation can be found and
rendered. Just stay calm and patient until the new layout appears. That's the
only thing you need to do.

Easy - you can do it!

New manual: "Tell me something about topic X"
---------------------------------------------

2018-02-02 by Martin Bless

Often questions are centered around topics: How does TYPO3
caching work? How can I improve performance? How to use
composer with TYPO3? And often answers are given in
blogpostings, slides, videos and so on.

`The new manual <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/TellMeSomethingAbout/>`__
is the dedicated spot to list and collect
those topics. And it's up to you and everybody in the
community to come up with explanations, helpful texts
and links.

Can we make that manual a success? Yes, we can!
Everybody is counting on YOU!

Next to many contributors fixing various documentation parts,
we're currently in a bigger restructuring process of main
manuals: Various documents are merged into one,
the Homepage gets some love to find stuff quicker and other
good stuff.

Stay tuned!
