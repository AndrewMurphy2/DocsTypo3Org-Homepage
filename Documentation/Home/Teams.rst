About the Teams @ Work Projects
===============================

The "Teams @ Work" projects for the `T3O Team <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/Teams/T3oTeam/>`__
(typo3.org website) and the `T3DocTeam <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/Teams/T3DocTeam/>`__ are documentation
projects based on the same technology as any documentation manual.
They can be used as information for the team members (and interested contributors).
They are (usually) hosted on GitHub in the
`TYPO3-Teams-Documentation <https://github.com/TYPO3-Teams-Documentation/>`__
organization (except for the doc manual, it is hosted on GitHub in the
`TYPO3-Documentation <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation>`__ organization,
like the other manuals).

If you are in one of the official TYPO3 teams and wish to start a
"Teams @ Work" project for your team, contact the Documentation Team in
the `#typo3-documentation <https://typo3.slack.com/messages/C028JEPJL>`__
Slack channel. We are happy to help with documentation in any way, if we can.
