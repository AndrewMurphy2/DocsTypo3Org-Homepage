Templating Tutorial updated
---------------------------

May 12, 2016, Francois Suter

The `Templating Tutorial (Basics)
<https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/TemplatingTutorial/>`__
is now up to date again.

More than refreshed, it was really refactored. This tutorial was accompanied by
files delivered via the extension called "doc_tut_templating". I have now made
this extension into a distribution, which makes it possible to deliver not only
the files but also a basic page tree with a few content element. This greatly
simplifies the early steps of the tutorial, which were redundant with the
Editors Tutorial.

I have reworked a lot of the content, which was quite verbose. It is now often
shorter and more to the point. I removed the chapter about "optionSplit",
which was confusing, and referred readers to the TypoScript Reference instead.

This ended up being a lot of work and this time I used all the time I had
planned in this budget milestone.
