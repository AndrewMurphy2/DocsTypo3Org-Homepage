:template: extensions.html

============================
Third party (TER) extensions
============================

.. ATTENTION:
   Be careful with this special folder /typo3cms/extensions !!!


.. First
   You may add normal rst content here.

Here you can find documentation for third party extensions
available through :ref:`TYPO3 Extension Repository (TER) <https://extensions.typo3.org/>`.

If you're looking for documentation of the extensions shipped with TYPO3 Core, go to the `system extensions section`. 

__ typo3cms/SystemExtensions/

The server tries to keep a `json file about extensions`__
up to date. Moreover there's a manually maintained
`json file about system extensions`__.

__ extensions.js
__ systemextensions.js



**Use the following form to search by extension keys.**


.. Second:
   Don't do anything more!
   Template 'extensions.html' will insert the necessary
   javascript and html to render the extension selection
   form here.

.. How does it work?
   This document has the file-wide-metadata field 'template'
   set to 'extensions.html'. So this document will use the
   template 'extensions.html' for rendering instead of the
   usual 'page.html' of normal pages.
   The logic for this is in __init__.py of t3SphinxThemeRtd,
   which is not only a theme but is loaded as Sphinx extension
   as well.
