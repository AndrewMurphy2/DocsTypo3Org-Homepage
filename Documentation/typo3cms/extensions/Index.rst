:template: extensions.html

============================
Third party (TER) extensions
============================

.. ATTENTION:
   Be careful with this special folder /typo3cms/extensions !!!

.. Note the special template 'extensions.html' (see beginning of this file)

.. First
   You may add normal rst content here.

Here you can find documentation for third party extensions available through
`TYPO3 Extension Repository (TER) <https://extensions.typo3.org/>`__.

If you're looking for documentation of the extensions shipped with TYPO3 Core,
go to the :ref:`system extensions section <System-Extensions>`.

The server tries to keep a `json file about extensions <extensions.js>`__ up to
date. Moreover there's a manually maintained `json file about system extensions
<systemextensions.js>`__.



**Use the following form to search by extension keys.**


.. Second:
   Don't do anything more!
   Template 'extensions.html' will insert the necessary
   javascript and html to render the extension selection
   form here.

.. How does it work?
   This document has the file-wide-metadata field 'template'
   set to 'extensions.html'. So this document will use the
   template 'extensions.html' for rendering instead of the
   usual 'page.html' of normal pages.
   The logic for this is in __init__.py of t3SphinxThemeRtd,
   which is not only a theme but is loaded as Sphinx extension
   as well.
