System Extensions
=================

Documentation of extensions managed within the core repository directly
and maintained by the core team and core contributors are called
*system extensions*. If working with the full core package, these
extensions can be found in :file:`typo3/sysext` directory.

Some of these extensions provide documentation, too. These are
listed here.

Documentation of system extensions in current core version
==========================================================

The list of extensions developed directly in the core repository
changes from time to time: Some extensions are merged into others,
some are integrated, others abandoned from core and maintained at
a different place.

The list below is kept in sync with the current development version
of the core, the table further below lists extensions that were
part of the core and extracted at some point in time.
