How can you contribute?
=======================

Your help is very much appreciated - no matter what way you choose.
Ways to contribute:

Edit me on Github
-----------------

The simplest way to contribute is by hitting the "Edit me on GitHub" button
that sits in the top right corner of every page. This will create a fork in your
own GitHub account, from which you can then create pull requests.

If you are unfamiliar with GitHub, please refer to the `GitHub Help <https://help.github.com/>`__

Watch the official YouTube video `Tutorial - Contribute to
docs.typo3.org <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNxO-aXY5Yw>`__
to get started.


More information: :ref:`h2document:docs-contribute`.

.. important::

   If you are familiar with git and docker, please consider using the
   :ref:`git / docker method <h2document:docs-contribute-quickstart>`.
   You will get better results for a rendering preview. And you might
   be more comforable using your preferred IDE / Editor than the
   Web GUI on Github.
