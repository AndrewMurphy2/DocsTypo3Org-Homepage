ext:devlog
----------

2016-11-14 by François Suter at `Forge <https://forge.typo3.org/news/810>`__:

   Version 3.0 released and moved to GitHub

   The road to devlog version 3.0 has been long and bumpy indeed. Years ago Fabien Udriot
   started a brand new version for TYPO3 4.5, using ExtJS for the backend module. The work
   was never finished and ExtJS fell from grace. The project lay dormant for a couple of years.
   Then an attempt was made to base the devlog on TYPO3's logging API, but this also faltered along the way.

   About last year I finally found the motivation to give the project yet another fresh start.
   Alternating sprints and breaks, the new version was eventually ready. It is entirely rewritten,
   with a squeaky clean code base. The backend module relies on jQuery and DataTables for paginating,
   searching and filtering. The "Clear log entries" feature is now available from a convenient drop-down.

   The devlog also now uses a concept of log writers, which makes it possible to route devlog
   calls to different outputs/storages. By default, the extension provides a database and a file writer.

   Last but not least, I moved the extension to GitHub. Hopefully this will help people contribute and
   maybe also shift ownership to someone else, as I don't feel like continuing to maintain this extension.
